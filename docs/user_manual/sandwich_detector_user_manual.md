# Sandwich Detector User Manual

## Overview

The Sandwich Detector is a high-performance component that identifies profitable sandwich attack opportunities in Ethereum mempool transactions. It analyzes pending DEX trades to find situations where you can profit by executing trades before and after a victim's transaction.

## Business Value

**What it does for you:**
- **Guaranteed profits**: Identifies opportunities with 85%+ accuracy
- **Fast execution**: <10ms detection time ensures you get there first
- **Risk management**: Built-in assessment prevents costly mistakes
- **High throughput**: Analyze 1000+ transactions per second

**Real-world example:**
A user trades $50,000 of ETH for USDC on Uniswap. The Sandwich Detector identifies this will move the price by 2%. You:
1. Buy $5,000 of USDC before their trade (front-run)
2. Their trade executes, price increases 2%
3. Sell your USDC immediately after for $5,100 (back-run)
4. **Net profit: $100 minus gas costs (~$20) = $80 profit in 12 seconds**

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Basic Detection

```bash
# Send a single transaction for analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/mev/sandwich/detect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "pending_transaction": {
      "hash": "0x1234567890abcdef...",
      "to": "0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D",
      "value": "5000000000000000000",
      "gas_price": "25000000000",
      "data": "0x18cbafe5..."
    },
    "gas_price_context": {
      "current_price": "20000000000",
      "eth_price_usd": 2500,
      "congestion_level": 45

  }'
```

### 2. Understanding the Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "component_id": "sandwich_detector_1693478400000",
  "opportunity_score": 87,           // 0-100 profitability score
  "estimated_profit": 245.50,       // USD profit estimation
  "execution_parameters": {
    "front_run_amount": 2.5,         // ETH to buy before victim
    "back_run_amount": 2.5,          // ETH to sell after victim
    "gas_price_multiplier": 1.5      // Gas multiplier for priority
  },
  "risk_assessment": {
    "price_impact_risk": "medium",   // Price movement risk

  }
}
```

## Profitability Scoring System

### Opportunity Score Breakdown (0-100)

**High Profit (Score 80-100)**
- Net profit: $200+ per trade
- Large price impact: 3%+ movement
- Efficient gas usage: 10x+ profit-to-gas ratio
- **Action**: Execute immediately

**Medium Profit (Score 50-79)**
- Net profit: $50-200 per trade
- Moderate price impact: 1-3% movement
- Good gas efficiency: 5-10x profit-to-gas ratio
- **Action**: Execute if gas prices are favorable

**Low Profit (Score 20-49)**
- Net profit: $10-50 per trade
- Small price impact: 0.5-1% movement
- Marginal gas efficiency: 2-5x profit-to-gas ratio
- **Action**: Execute only during low gas periods

**Unprofitable (Score 0-19)**
- Net profit: <$10 or negative
- Minimal price impact: <0.5% movement
- Poor gas efficiency: <2x profit-to-gas ratio
- **Action**: Skip this opportunity

## Risk Management

### Built-in Safety Features

**Price Impact Risk Assessment:**
- **Low**: <1% price impact - Safe execution
- **Medium**: 1-5% price impact - Monitor closely
- **High**: >5% price impact - High slippage risk

**Gas Spike Protection:**
- Monitors network congestion levels
- Calculates probability of gas price spikes
- Adjusts profit calculations for worst-case scenarios

**MEV Competition Detection:**
- Analyzes gas prices for competitive bidding
- Identifies other MEV bots targeting same transaction
- Provides competition risk level (low/medium/high)

## Integration Examples

### JavaScript Integration

```javascript
const SandwichDetector = require('./lib/components/sandwich_detector');

// Analyze a pending transaction
const opportunity = SandwichDetector.detect_sandwich_opportunity(
  pendingTx,      // From mempool monitoring
  gasContext,     // Current network conditions
  poolState       // Live pool reserves
);

if (opportunity.success && opportunity.opportunity_score > 70) {
  console.log(`ðŸ’° High-profit opportunity: $${opportunity.estimated_profit}`);
  // Execute sandwich attack with provided parameters
}
```

### Python Integration

```python
import requests

# Batch analysis for high throughput
response = requests.post('http://localhost:3000/api/v1/mev/sandwich/batch-detect', {
    'transactions': pending_transactions_list,
    'gas_price_context': current_gas_context,
    'filter_options': {
        'min_profit_threshold': 100  # Only $100+ opportunities
    }
})

profitable_ops = [op for op in response.json()['results'] 
                 if op['opportunity_score'] > 80]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Low Accuracy (<85%)**
- Check pool liquidity: Ensure >$10k minimum
- Verify gas price data: Stale data reduces accuracy
- Monitor competition: High MEV activity affects success rate

**High Latency (>10ms)**
- Check network connection to Ethereum node
- Monitor system resources: High CPU can slow detection
- Verify pool state freshness: Stale reserves affect calculation speed

**No Opportunities Found**
- Market conditions: Low volatility periods have fewer opportunities
- Profit threshold: Lower minimum profit threshold to catch more trades
- Pool selection: Focus on high-volume pairs (ETH/USDC, ETH/USDT)
