## Strategic Questions for Blockchain Node Infrastructure

### 1. Full Blockchain Nodes for MEV Advantages

**Primary Question**: Does running our own full blockchain nodes provide significant advantages for MEV extraction and arbitrage trading?

**Specific Considerations**:
- **Mempool Access**: Can we get earlier/direct access to pending transactions before they hit public mempools?
- **Block Construction**: What level of control/influence do we get over transaction ordering?
- **Latency Reduction**: How much faster can we detect and respond to MEV opportunities?
- **Data Quality**: Will running our own nodes improve the quality of data for ML model training?
- **Cost vs Benefit**: What are the operational costs vs potential profit improvements?

### 2. Validator Node Operations

**Economic Opportunity**: Should we operate validator nodes for additional revenue streams?

**Blockchain-Specific Questions**:
- **Ethereum**: ETH staking rewards vs MEV extraction - which provides better ROI?
- **Solana**: Validator economics and hardware requirements
- **Other Chains**: Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Chain validation opportunities
- **Liquid Staking**: Should we run our own liquid staking protocol?

### 3. Mempool Control & Block Proposing

**Advanced MEV Strategy**: Can we leverage validator status for enhanced MEV extraction?

**Technical Capabilities**:
- **Block Proposing**: If we're validators, can we include our own MEV transactions first?
- **MEV-Boost Integration**: Should we integrate with Flashbots or similar MEV-boost relays?
- **Private Mempools**: Can we create private transaction pools for institutional clients?
- **Searcher Operations**: Should we operate as MEV searchers in addition to our trading bots?

### 4. Recommended Blockchain Node Setup
