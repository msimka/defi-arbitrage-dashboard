# DeFi Arbitrage Dashboard - Architecture Consultation

## Project Overview
We're building a comprehensive DeFi trading platform that combines traditional arbitrage with advanced MEV strategies, meme coin sniping, and ML/TD learning for algorithmic trading. Think "E-Trade Pro for DeFi" with thousands of trading opportunities across multiple chains.

## Current Implementation Status

### üîÑ **Arbitrage & MEV Strategies (Implemented)**

#### Flash Loan Arbitrage
- **Aave Flash Loans**: Borrow large amounts without collateral for same-block arbitrage
- **Cross-DEX**: Price discrepancy detection between Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap
- **Multi-chain**: Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum support

#### MEV Bot Strategies
- **Sandwich Attacks**: Monitor mempool for large trades, front-run + back-run for guaranteed profits (like the $100 profit on $3000 trade you mentioned)
- **Front-running**: Execute trades ahead of detected opportunities
- **Back-running**: Capitalize on price movements after transactions
- **Liquidation Sniping**: Target undercollateralized positions

### üéØ **Meme Coin & Sniper Trading (Implemented)**

#### Multi-Platform Token Discovery
- **Pump.fun**: Solana meme coin launchpad (1M+ tokens in 2024) - API polling every 3 seconds
- **DEXScreener**: Real-time WebSocket across 30+ chains for new pairs
- **DEXTools**: DeFi analytics integration
- **Jupiter**: Solana DEX aggregator with smart routing
- **Moonshot**: DEXScreener's audited launchpad

#### Solana Sniper Bot
- **Millisecond-precision sniping** on new token launches
- **Automated trading** with profit targets (100% default), stop losses (50%), trailing stops (20%)
- **Security screening** to avoid rug pulls and scam tokens
- **Risk/Potential scoring** (0-100% for both metrics)

#### Target Markets
- **Low market cap**: $5k-$1M sweet spot for maximum growth potential
- **High volume**: Minimum liquidity thresholds
- **New launches**: First 24 hours for maximum volatility
