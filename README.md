# DeFi Arbitrage Dashboard

A comprehensive DeFi trading platform for micro arbitrage opportunities with ML-driven strategies.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an E-Trade Pro equivalent for DeFi, providing:
- Access to thousands of liquidity pools across multiple protocols
- Real-time arbitrage opportunity detection
- High-frequency micro trading capabilities
- ML and TD Learning for algorithmic trading strategies
- Comprehensive dashboard for monitoring and execution

## Supported Protocols & Aggregators

### Primary Aggregators
- **1inch**: Leading DEX aggregator with 60% market share, supports 20+ protocols
- **Aave**: Liquidity protocol for lending/borrowing with $7.5B TVL
- **Uniswap**: Largest DEX with $12.3B market cap and $6.7B weekly volume
- **Curve**: Optimized for stablecoin trading with minimal slippage
- **Balancer**: Flexible AMM with weighted pools
- **SushiSwap**: Community-driven DEX with yield farming

### Meme Coin & Low Market Cap Platforms
- **Pump.fun**: Solana meme coin launchpad (1M+ tokens launched in 2024)
- **DEXScreener**: Real-time tracking across 30+ chains for new pairs
- **DEXTools**: DeFi analytics and token discovery
- **Moonshot**: DEXScreener's audited token launchpad
- **Jupiter**: Solana DEX aggregator with smart routing

### Low Market Cap Opportunities
- **DEGEN**: Layer-3 meme coin with 13x growth potential
- **VeChain (VET)**: Enterprise DeFi integration
- **Emerging Layer-2 tokens**: Optimism ($5.6B TVL), Base ($2.2B TVL)
- **Solana meme coins**: Early-stage tokens from Pump.fun ecosystem

## Key Features

### Arbitrage Detection
- Flash loan arbitrage bots (using Aave Flash Loans)
- Cross-DEX price discrepancy detection
- MEV bot strategies (frontrunning, sandwiching, backrunning)
- Real-time mempool monitoring

### MEV Trading Strategies
- **Sandwich Attacks**: Buy before large trades, sell after for guaranteed profits
- **Front-running**: Execute trades ahead of detected opportunities
- **Back-running**: Capitalize on price movements after transactions
- **Liquidation Sniping**: Target undercollateralized positions

### Meme Coin & Sniper Features
- **Token Discovery**: Real-time monitoring of Pump.fun, DEXScreener, Jupiter
- **Solana Sniping**: Millisecond-precision token sniping on new launches
- **Risk Assessment**: Automated security checks and rug pull detection
- **Auto-Trading**: Profit targets, stop losses, and trailing stops

### Trading Capabilities
- High-frequency micro trades
- Risk management with stop-loss and slippage tolerance
- Gas optimization for maximum profitability
- Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum)

### Dashboard Components
- Real-time portfolio tracking
- Liquidity pool analytics
- Arbitrage opportunity alerts
- Performance metrics and P&L tracking
- Risk assessment tools

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js/Python**: Core trading logic
- **Web3.js/Ethers.js**: Blockchain interaction
- **Redis**: Real-time data caching
- **PostgreSQL**: Trade history and analytics

### Frontend
